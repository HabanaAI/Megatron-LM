# Megatron Overview
This implementation is based on https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM at core_r0.9.0.

This repository comprises two essential components: Megatron-LM and Megatron-Core. Megatron-LM serves as a research-oriented framework leveraging Megatron-Core for large language model (LLM) training. Megatron-Core, on the other hand, is a library of optimized training techniques including versioned APIs and regular releases. Alternatively, you can integrate Megatron-Core's building blocks into your preferred training framework.

## Megatron-LM
First introduced in 2019, Megatron ([1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04473), and [3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05198)) sparked a wave of innovation in the AI community, enabling researchers and developers to utilize the underpinnings of this library to further LLM advancements.

## Megatron-Core
Megatron-Core is an open-source PyTorch-based library that contains optimized techniques and cutting-edge system-level optimizations. It abstracts them into composable and modular APIs, allowing full flexibility for developers and model researchers to train custom transformers at-scale on accelerated computing infrastructure.

Megatron-Core offers core building blocks such as attention mechanisms, transformer blocks and layers, normalization layers, and embedding techniques. Additional functionality like activation recomputation, distributed checkpointing is also natively built-in to the library. The building blocks and functionality are all optimized, and can be built with advanced parallelization strategies for optimal training speed and stability on Accelerated Computing Infrastructure. Another key component of the Megatron-Core library includes advanced model parallelism techniques (tensor, sequence, pipeline, context, and MoE expert parallelism).

# Setup
Please follow the instructions provided in the [Intel Gaudi Installation Guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/index.html)
to set up the environment including the `$PYTHON` environment variable. To achieve the best performance, please follow the methods outlined in the [Optimizing Training Platform guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/Model_Optimization_PyTorch/Optimization_in_Training_Platform.html).
The guides will walk you through the process of setting up your system to run the model on Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3.

## Prerequisites
* When creating Docker container, set the shared memory size as 10 GB through the Docker run command:
  ```bash
  --shm-size=10g
  ```

## Clone Intel Gaudi Megatron-LM
In the Docker container, clone this repository and switch to the branch that matches your Intel Gaudi software version.
You can run the [`hl-smi`](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/System_Management_Tools_Guide/System_Management_Tools.html#hl-smi-utility-options) utility to determine the Intel Gaudi software version.
```bash
git clone -b [Intel Gaudi software version] https://github.com/HabanaAI/Megatron-LM
```
Set the required environment variables as shown below:
```
export MEGATRON_LM_ROOT=/path/to/Megatron-LM
export PYTHONPATH=$MEGATRON_LM_ROOT:$PYTHONPATH
```
## Install Megatron-LM Requirements
* In the Docker container, go to the Megatron-LM directory:
  ```bash
  cd $MEGATRON_LM_ROOT
  ```

* Install the required packages using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install -r megatron/core/requirements.txt
  ```

* To run training on more than 128 cards, apply the below configuration changes:
  ```bash
  echo '*    soft nofile  unlimited' >> /etc/security/limits.conf
  echo '*    hard nofile  unlimited' >> /etc/security/limits.conf
  echo 'root soft nofile  unlimited' >> /etc/security/limits.conf
  echo 'root hard nofile  unlimited' >> /etc/security/limits.conf
  ```

# Changelog
## 1.20.1
- Enabled Dynamic MoE computation on HPU with `IntelDynamicMLP` which supports bf16 and fp32 precision. Token routing inside the EP/TP group and reductions in and between groups are internalized within the fused MoE kernel, which speeds up training and improves token balancing by minimizing padding. No tokens are dropped. DP/TP/EP/PP/SP modes are supported.
- Added different levels of memory optimization for exporting or loading distributed optimizer states, controlled via an argument.

## 1.20.0
- Changed the default behavior of "accumulate_allreduce_grads_in_fp32" for the bfloat16 data type. Instead of performing gradient accumulation and all-reduce in fp32, it is sufficient to do so in bfloat16 for some configurations. However, for configurations where Gradient Accumulutation Steps * data parallel size > 256, switching to fp32 is necessary.
- Rebased code to upstream [core_r0.9.0](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/core_r0.9.0) release.

## 1.19.0
 - Added support for Gaudi 3.
 - Added LLaMA 3.1 support and set as default.
 - Added Megatron-LM to Hugging Face LLaMA and Mixtral checkpoint conversion support. Usage example is available [here](./tools/checkpoint/README.md#llama-convert-megatron-lm-to-hugging-face-checkpoint).
 - Added Hugging Face to Megatron-LM LLaMA and Mixtral checkpoint conversion support. Usage example is available [here](./tools/checkpoint/README.md#llama-convert-hugging-face-checkpoint-to-megatron-lm).
 - Added Mixtral 8x7b BF16 support (preview version) [here](./examples/mixtral/README.md).

## 1.18.0
 - Initial release.
