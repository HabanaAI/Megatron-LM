# Setup
Please follow the instructions provided in the [Intel Gaudi Installation Guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/index.html)
to set up the environment including the `$PYTHON` environment variable. To achieve the best performance, please follow the methods outlined in the [Optimizing Training Platform guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/Model_Optimization_PyTorch/Optimization_in_Training_Platform.html).
The guides will walk you through the process of setting up your system to run the model on Gaudi 2.

## Prerequisites
* When creating Docker container, set the shared memory size as 10 GB through the Docker run command:
  ```bash
  --shm-size=10g
  ```

## Clone Intel Gaudi Megatron-LM
In the Docker container, clone this repository and switch to the branch that matches your Intel Gaudi software version.
You can run the [`hl-smi`](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/System_Management_Tools_Guide/System_Management_Tools.html#hl-smi-utility-options) utility to determine the Intel Gaudi software version.
```bash
git clone -b [Intel Gaudi software version] https://github.com/HabanaAI/Megatron-LM
```
Set the required environment variables as shown below:
```
export MEGATRON_LM_ROOT=/path/to/Megatron-LM
export PYTHONPATH=$MEGATRON_LM_ROOT:$PYTHONPATH
```
## Install Mixtral Requirements
* In the Docker container, go to the Megatron-LM directory:
  ```bash
  cd $MEGATRON_LM_ROOT
  ```

* Install the required packages using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install -r megatron/core/requirements.txt
  pip install -r examples/mixtral/requirements.txt
  ```

* To run training on more than 128 cards, apply the below configuration changes:
  ```bash
  echo '*    soft nofile  unlimited' >> /etc/security/limits.conf
  echo '*    hard nofile  unlimited' >> /etc/security/limits.conf
  echo 'root soft nofile  unlimited' >> /etc/security/limits.conf
  echo 'root hard nofile  unlimited' >> /etc/security/limits.conf
  ```

## Dataset
Follow the instructions in https://github.com/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data/tree/main to recreate RedPajama dataset.


# Mpirun Settings
These are system specific settings. Use these parameters for efficient allocation of resources and optimized performance. Please refer [mpirun Configuration](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/PyTorch_Scaling_Guide/DDP_Based_Scaling.html#mpirun-configuration) for more details.
* parallel environments (PEs) value is used to define how many processing elements(CPU cores) to be used for a given job. It is used as --map-by socket:PE=n. i.e. bind 'n' CPU cores to each MPI process.
  ```
  HL_PE=13
  ```
* processes per resource (PPR) specifies how many MPI processes should be launched per specific resource (socket). It is mostly used in multi-node training, used as --map-by ppr:n:socket:PE=m. i.e. 'n' MPI processes on each processor socket & bind 'm' CPU cores to each MPI process.
  ```
  HL_PPR=4
  ```

# Training Script Settings
* Based on the tokenization method, update the tokenizer type:
  ```
  HL_TOKENIZER_TYPE=GPTSentencePieceTokenizer
  ```
* Update data root dir with the path of your choice:
  ```
  HL_DATA_DIR_ROOT=/data/bigscience/red_pajama
  ```
* Update data file prefix(*.bin and *.idx) based on file name in data root dir:
  ```
  HL_DATA_FILE_PREFIX=sample
  ```
* Update tokenizer.model file path if it is not in data root dir, required for any sentence piece based tokenizer:
  ```
  HL_TOKENIZER_MODEL=path/to/tokenizer.model
  ```
* To run in lazy mode
  ```
  HL_USE_LAZY_MODE=1
  ```
* To run in pure eager mode
  ```
  HL_USE_LAZY_MODE=0
  HL_TORCH_COMPILE_DISABLE=1
  ```

Note: For the training commands, make sure to change the IP addresses in hostsfile according to your setup.
`HL_RESULTS_DIR` and `HL_DATA_DIR_ROOT` must be shared writable across all nodes and launchers when running training on more than 8 cards.
The same applies to `HL_CHECKPOINTS_DIR`, `HL_TENSORBOARD_DIR` and `HL_KILL_SWITCH` if specified.
If `HL_DATA_DIR_ROOT` is not writable, then `HL_CACHE_PATH` must be set to a writable location and
must be shared and accessible across all nodes and launchers when running training on more than 8 cards.

Note: `HL_USE_LAZY_MODE=0` will run in mixed mode with eager and compile due to fusions enabled by default. To get pure eager mode for direct comparison of eager and compile mode performance, user needs to set environment variables `HL_USE_LAZY_MODE=0` and `HL_TORCH_COMPILE_DISABLE=1`.

### Mixtral Training and Examples
* Training of Mixtral is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04088

### Multi-Card Training Examples
Configure the following for the Mixtral examples below:
* Set the correct path for `HL_DATA_DIR_ROOT`.
* Set the correct values for `HL_TOKENIZER_TYPE` and `HL_DATA_FILE_PREFIX`.
* Add `HL_DATA_CACHE_DIR` and/or `HL_TOKENIZER_MODEL` if necessary.

Refer to [training script settings](#training-script-settings) for details.

### Activation Checkpointing
`HL_CKP_ACT` has 4 modes:
* 0 - no checkpointing
* 1 - full-layer checkpointing `--recompute-granularity full --recompute-method uniform`
* 2 - selective checkpoinitng `--recompute-granularity selective`
* 3 - moe-layer recompute only `--moe-layer-recompute`
This can be additonaly paired with Fused SDPA recompute `HL_USE_FUSED_SDPA_WITH_RECOMPUTE=1`.
More information on these settings can be found in the main README section.

### Validated Configurations for MoE
* For the best performance and model accuracy, use MoE with the Fused MoE Kernel, as shown in the example below.
* For configurations with MoE Capacity Factor or Capacity Bins, use AllToAll Token Dispatcher. The AllGather Token Dispatcher is sufficient for basic drop/dropless mode.
* Tensor, Data, Expert and Pipeline Parallel modes have been validated with the HPU Fused MoE Kernel and other MoE configurations.

The following Mixtral 8x7B configuration has been validated as the most effective for Gaudi 2:
4DP+8TP+SP with 8 experts top-2 and 32k sequence length and Aux Loss for load balancing.

### Run Mixtral 8x7b on 32 HPUs, Lazy mode, with BF16 precision, sequence length 32k:
  ```
  HL_HOSTSFILE=$MEGATRON_LM_ROOT/examples/hostsfile \
  HL_NUM_NODES=4 \
  HL_DP=4 \
  HL_TP=8 \
  HL_SEQ_PARALLEL=1 \
  HL_CKP_ACT=3 \
  HL_USE_FUSED_SDPA_WITH_RECOMPUTE=1 \
  HL_MOE_DYNAMIC=1 \
  HL_DIST_OPTIMIZER=1 \
  $MEGATRON_LM_ROOT/examples/mixtral/pretrain_mixtral.sh
  ```

### Run Mixtral 8x7b on 32 HPUs, Lazy mode, with BF16 precision, sequence length 32k and Context Parallelism:
  ```
  HL_HOSTSFILE=$MEGATRON_LM_ROOT/examples/hostsfile \
  HL_USE_FAST_SOFTMAX=0 \
  HL_NUM_NODES=4 \
  HL_DP=2 \
  HL_CP=2 \
  HL_TP=8 \
  HL_SEQ_PARALLEL=1 \
  HL_CKP_ACT=0 \
  HL_USE_FUSED_SDPA_WITH_RECOMPUTE=1 \
  HL_MOE_DYNAMIC=1 \
  HL_DIST_OPTIMIZER=1 \
  $MEGATRON_LM_ROOT/examples/mixtral/pretrain_mixtral.sh
  ```

# Useful Tools

### Analysis of token distribution among experts
Use `HL_MOE_TOKEN_DISTRIBUTION_LOGGING=1` to enable token distribution logging (by default disabled). To modify the log interval,
use `HL_MOE_TOKEN_DISTRIBUTION_LOGGING_INTERVAL=your_desired_value` (the default is 50). Logger produces the following table to the console:
```
|   Expert 0 |   Expert 1 |   Expert 2 |   Expert 3 |   Expert 4 |   Expert 5 |   Expert 6 |   Expert 7 |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
|         48 |         76 |       3120 |      13952 |        249 |      15104 |        191 |         15 |
|        193 |        220 |      10112 |      13696 |        444 |       7360 |        664 |         43 |
|         77 |        241 |      13440 |      14016 |        364 |       4000 |        660 |         20 |
|        106 |       1312 |      10880 |      13760 |       2256 |       3888 |        560 |         18 |
```
Single row represents results accumulated from all micro-batches, so they should sum to approx.: `seq_len * topk * gbs`.
If there are more than one layer, table for each of them will be provided. Token distribution is also present in a form of heatmap in tensorboard logs.

### Megatron-LM/Hugging Face Transformers Checkpoint Converter

The tools convert between distributed Megatron-LM and Hugging Face checkpoint formats, enabling easier loading and deployment with the Hugging Face Transformers library. Bidirectional conversion is supported (MLM -> HF as well as HF -> MLM).

For more information, please see [tools/checkpoint/README.md](../../tools/checkpoint/README.md).
